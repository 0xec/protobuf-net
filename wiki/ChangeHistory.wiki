=Work In Progress=

Not available in [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/downloads/list Downloads], but available as [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/source/list Source].

  * DateTime/TimeSpan support for tick-level precision and/or Fixed64 encoding
  * Moved WCF to non-default port (false positive failures due to conflicts)
  * Fixed Int64 encoding bug [whoops!]
  * Allow tag inference (comparable to WCF behaviour) [opt-in only]
  * Removed class/new constraints for [most] Serializer methods
  * Support direct serialization of IList<T>/T[]/IEnumerable<T>+Add(T) objects

==20 Aug 2008: r153==

Oops - a bit of a change gap...

  * Refactored property implementation for performance
  * Support for multiple readers for a single property
  * Various .proto emitter fixes
  * Support for DateTime etc as "bcl" messages
  * Uses optimistic length guess (rather than full length calculation) for sub-messages
  * Support for full streaming (IEnumerable<T>/Add rather than IList<T>)
  * Re-worked array/list to peek for next item (replaces naïve from r90)
  * Multi-byte utf8 fixes
  * Various other fixes

==24 Jul 2008: r90==

  * Performance; "workspace" buffer now always 0-based; uses lightweight recursion check up to threshold; length prediction streamlined; encode now writes to stream (not workspace)
  * Support for single-dimension arrays (naïve implementation)
  * Support for Compact Framework 2.0 & 3.5
  * Support for extension fields encoded as groups (includes dropping data for inextensible objects)
  * Fixed handling of type-init / dynamic-invoke exceptions
  * Code tidied as per code analysis / source analysis
  
==23 Jul 2008: r72==

  * Support for deserializing known sub-object fields encoded using groups (data is serialized as length-prefixed; not supported for extension fields)
  * Support for [Extensions extension] fields
  * Recursion detection when serializing


==22 Jul 2008: r53==

  * Optimised field lookup during deserialization
  * Wcf example
  * Silverlight example
  * Support for enums
  * Compatibility tweaks (C# 2 / mono / .NET 2.0 / VS2005 / Sliverlight)
