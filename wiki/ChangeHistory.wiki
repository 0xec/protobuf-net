(the big refactor...)

= Releases =

Avaialable via [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/downloads/list Downloads].

==02 Jun 2009: r255==

  * Packed encoding support for lists, arrays, etc
  * Support for packed and deprecated from .proto
  * Updated protoc 2.1
  
==22 May 2009==

  * Improved support for namespaces when using multiple .proto files;
    * added -ns:{ns} to specify a default namespace (used when there is no package)
    * added -p:import={imports} to specify namespaces to import ("using")
    * fixed bug with default namespace

==02 Apr 2009==

  * Allow data-member offset in Silverlight
  * Fix bug deserializing nested list/enumerables
  * More RPC prep
  * ProtoGen now uses exe path correctly

==26 Mar 2009==

  * Early (not final) draft of working RPC, including C# 3.0 extension / lambda usage.
  * Beginnings of major refactor to split the model from attributes
  * Added support for multiple services on http endpoint

==02 Mar 2009==

  * Strong naming of CF20/CF35/Mono

==19 Feb 2009==

  * Better support for *Specified; non-public; get-only; instance
  
==16 Feb 2009==

  * Use Reflection.Emit to access fields (rather than reflection) when available
  * Introduce callback interface (not yet integrated)
  * Add TryReadLengthPrefix to public API (for async network usage)

==13 Feb 2009: r230==

  * Support {name}Specified pattern
  * xslt changes for above (includes ComponentModel etc); general xslt tidy
  * Better trace info when deserialization explodes (in exception data)
  * Complain if [ProtoInclude] conflicts with an existing tag
  
==09 Feb 2009: r225==

  * Fixed inheritance issue when a property (or list) is defined a *subtype* of a contract; [de]serializes starting
    from the highest contract ancestor (previously started from member type)
  * Consider abstract types as contracts (allows for abstract contract ancestors for above change)
  * Fixed inheritance issue when [de]serializing via Serializer
  * Removed [ProtoContract] from Extensible - breaks derived classes
  
==10 Dec 2008: r219==

  * Allow offset via attribute for WCF (data-member) usage; allows compatibility between WCF client/LINQ server
  * Thread safety of Build() method (per-type lock, with zero-lock short-circuit once built)
  * Workaround for mono compiler (generics) bug; verifies constraint at runtime rather than compile
  * Integrated mono/nant into build script and zip  

==25 Nov 2008: r214==

  * ProtoGen: simpler field names; default unspecified field-type to double (not int)
  * Fixed private class issue on CF 2.0

==21 Nov 2008: r212==

  * Implicit fields skips delegates (including event-backers) and [NonSerialized]
  * Detect CF 2.0 non-public runtime bug and offer advice
  
==20 Nov 2008: r211==

  * Allow (optional) implicit serialization of fields (like BinaryFormatter) or the entire public API
  * Make QuickStart customer/contact public for CF 2.0 security glitch
  * Bugfix with inheritance (affected all except MemoryStream)

==11 Nov 2008: r202==

  * Minor buffer / encoding optimisations
  * .proto parser (ProtoGen)
  * Support dictionary / keyvaluepair
  * Buildkit
  * Start of RPC stack

==13 Oct 2008: r177==

  * Allow creation via non-public constructors, and allow Merge on objects without any parameterless constructor
  * Clarified error message for (failed) creation without a parameterless constructor
  * Support fields in addition to properties
  * Add quotes to string-based defaults (waiting on escape clarification)

==06 Oct 2008: r172==

  * Allow  [http://groups.google.com/group/protobuf/browse_thread/thread/8f6e9ba3ee923bdb negative enum values]
  * Changed GetPassThru to side-step Mono compiler issue (note compiler bug fixed in mono 2.0)
  * QuickStart sample begun; SubStream re-introduced for NetworkStream sample
    "WithLengthPrefix" methods added to assist with sockets-based usage
  
==18 Sep 2008: r164==

  * DateTime/TimeSpan support for tick-level precision and/or Fixed64 encoding
  * Moved WCF unit tests to non-default port (false positive failures due to conflicts)
  * Fixed Int64 encoding bug (whoops!)
  * Allow tag inference (comparable to WCF behaviour, opt-in only)
  * Removed class/new constraints for [most] Serializer methods
  * Support direct serialization of `IList<T>`/`T[]`/`IEnumerable<T>`+`Add(T)` objects
  * Added global default for InferTagFromName
  * Enabled WCF serialization of list/array
  * Primatives / string / etc can now be serialized directly (without an entity)

==20 Aug 2008: r153==

Oops - a bit of a change gap...

  * Refactored property implementation for performance
  * Support for multiple readers for a single property
  * Various .proto emitter fixes
  * Support for DateTime etc as "bcl" messages
  * Uses optimistic length guess (rather than full length calculation) for sub-messages
  * Support for full streaming (IEnumerable<T>/Add rather than IList<T>)
  * Re-worked array/list to peek for next item (replaces naïve from r90)
  * Multi-byte utf8 fixes
  * Various other fixes

==24 Jul 2008: r90==

  * Performance; "workspace" buffer now always 0-based; uses lightweight recursion check up to threshold; length prediction streamlined; encode now writes to stream (not workspace)
  * Support for single-dimension arrays (naïve implementation)
  * Support for Compact Framework 2.0 & 3.5
  * Support for extension fields encoded as groups (includes dropping data for inextensible objects)
  * Fixed handling of type-init / dynamic-invoke exceptions
  * Code tidied as per code analysis / source analysis
  
==23 Jul 2008: r72==

  * Support for deserializing known sub-object fields encoded using groups (data is serialized as length-prefixed; not supported for extension fields)
  * Support for [Extensions extension] fields
  * Recursion detection when serializing


==22 Jul 2008: r53==

  * Optimised field lookup during deserialization
  * Wcf example
  * Silverlight example
  * Support for enums
  * Compatibility tweaks (C# 2 / mono / .NET 2.0 / VS2005 / Sliverlight)
